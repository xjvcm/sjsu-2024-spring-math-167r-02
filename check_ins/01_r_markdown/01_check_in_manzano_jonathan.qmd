1. This is a code chunk that opens the `mtcars` dataset, which contains 
information about on 32 cars from a 1974 issue of the magazine *Motor Trend* 
and creates a scatter plot with horsepower `hp` on the x-axis and 
miles-per-gallon `mpg` on the y-axis. Try running this code and 
Rendering/Knitting your Rmd document. If you have done this correctly, RStudio 
should produce an html document.  
  
```{r}
#| eval: true

data(mtcars)
plot(mtcars$hp, mtcars$mpg)
```

2. Using this scatter plot, describe the relationship between `mpg` and `hp`.  
  
> **`mpg` and `hp` are observed to have an inverse relationship. When the values 
of `hp` are low, the values of `mpg` are high and vice versa.**  
  
3. Create your own code chunk below this question containing the line of code 
`print("Hello MATH167R!")`. Then Render/Knit your Rmd document. If you have done
this correctly, RStudio should produce an html document.  
  
```{r}
print("Hello MATH167R!")
```
